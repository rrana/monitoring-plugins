### How It Works
Arguments:
The script uses `argparse` to accept six parameters:

* `dbname`: The database name to connect to.
* `db_endpoint`: The host or endpoint of the Aurora PostgreSQL instance.
* `db_port`: The port number.
* `db_username`: Username for the database.
* `db_password`: Password for the database.
* `threshold`: An integer threshold for the maximum allowed connection count.

Database Query:
It connects to the database and runs a simple SQL query:

```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;
```

This returns the count of all connections.

Nagios Output:

* If the connection count is greater than the threshold, it prints a `CRITICAL` message and exits with code `2`.
* Otherwise, it prints an `OK` message and exits with code `0`.
* In case of any error during connection or query execution, it prints an `UNKNOWN` message and exits with code `3`.

This script should integrate well with Nagios as a plugin for monitoring your Aurora PostgreSQL connection count.
